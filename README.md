Init publish - all automatic defaults - I don't trust this thing

URL to clone: https://github.com/DubDublin/DVblog.git

No idea why it put the publish comments here instead of what it asked me to put in the READM.md file.

I do NOT know why anyone would ever trust Git or any other version control system to keep anything safe.  This damn thing just refuses to even see the local Repo (even though all the files are definitely there, and were syncing a few hours ago), although the Repo and it's contents (which match the files on the local disk) are up at GitHub, because I can see them through the web interface.  The local client refuses to admint kmnowing of any Repos at all!

Use Git!  LOSE your data!
